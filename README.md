# Rain Walker

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.11 that adds the **Rain Walker** enchantment.

## Features

**Rain Walker** lets you run through the rain on ice platforms - like the dragons in *Raya and the Last Dragon* flying through rain.

- Enchantment for boots
- Creates ice platforms under your feet when falling in rain
- Prevents fall damage when ice is placed
- Ice disappears after 1-2 seconds (no water left behind)
- Only works when exposed to rain (open sky + raining)
- Treasure enchantment (found in loot, not enchanting table)
- Mutually exclusive with Frost Walker and Depth Strider
